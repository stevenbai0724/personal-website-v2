Hello, my name is Steven!

I am a third-year student at the University of Waterloo and a Software Engineer with a diverse set of full-stack tools. I have a strong interest in algorithms and leveraging AI to automate workflows and solve complex problems.

In addition to my passion for coding, I have a keen interest in making career and lifestyle vlogs. I also used to compete in swimming and amateur kickboxing. I do my best to capture my journey on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@stevenbai0724).

You can also read more about my journey in my [writings](/blog). Here's a quick glimpse of my software engineering journey and the companies I've been fortunate to contribute to:

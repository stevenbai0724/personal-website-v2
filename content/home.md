Hello, my name is Steven!

I am a Software Engineer and student at the University of Waterloo beginning my 3A term in Fall 2024. Here's a quick glimpse of my software engineering journey and the companies I've had the opportunity to work with:

In addition to my passion for technology and coding, I have a keen interest in vlogging and kickboxing. I have a lot of fun on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@stevenbai0724) making videos about my university years, and I love to stay physically and mentally sharp with competitive sports!
